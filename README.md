# OpenType Feature Bundle

This covers Adobe’s [OpenType Feature File Specification](http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html) used by the AFDKO. As well as syntax highlighting, there are also a couple of snippets for creating features, tables etc.

## Install
